# Strider Launcher

A contemporary project manager and launcher designed for Stride Game Engine And built using Avalonia UI with clean MVVM architecture.
Strider Launcher is my own personal project that aims to rework Stride with a more modern UI and better usability with a maintainable architecture. 
The project tries to create a new launcher using Avalonia to enable cross platform support. The official launcher feels dated and tightly coupled with old WPF patterns.
I have implemented basic dependency injection for each page within the launcher; the goal is to provide every function the previous launcher did and more. 
It’s currently in very active development and most features remain unfinished but here is a screenshot of the improved dashboard for insight into the project.
