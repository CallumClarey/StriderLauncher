StriderLauncher.

A contemporary project manager and launcher designed for Stride Game Engine And built using Avalonia UI with clean MVVM architecture.

StriderLauncher is my own personal project that aims to rework Stride with a more modern UI and better usability with a maintainable architecture. The project tries to create a new launcher using Avalonia to support WinUI. The official launcher feels dated and tightly coupled with old WPF patterns. I have implemented basic dependency injection for each page within the launcher, the goal is to provide every function the previous laucher did and more. Its currently a very active development and most features remain unfinished but here is a screenshot of the improved dashboard.
